to compile
gcc raid.c -o raid
gcc unraid.c -o unraid

to run raid
first, delete info.txt
./raid scarletletter.txt 4 2
where
	-scarletletter.txt=file to be raided
	-4=number of backup files to be created (computers involved in the raid)
	-2=which backup is the parity for this file (in this case, files 0-3 are the options)

to run unraid
make sure info.txt is there

./unraid 4
where 
	-4=number of backup files existing (computers involved in the raid)


This is designed to be used in a distributed network backup where the backup.txt files are distributed across a network and each stored on a different computer, as an alternative to people having to pay for backup services.
